# Queue
The behavior of a queue is that whatever goes in first, must come out first. One can visualise this as water or disks being pushed through a pipe that has two ends. \
\
Whatever goes in first, comes out the otherside first.

## Instance fields
For a queue, we can use an array to store the data in a queue and just have this represent how data would flow through it.\
\
Thus the only instance field we would use in the class would be an array.

## Methods 
For methods, we would want:
- Peak (check the first element)
- Push (add an item to the queue)
- Pop (take the first item out of the queue)
- Print (display the whole queue, stating the fist and last item)
- Reset queue
